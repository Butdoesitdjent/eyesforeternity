<h1><strong><i>"To Him Who Overcomes..."</i></strong></h1>
<h2><center><p>
During this time even more I'm hearing "go pray" that's all. Less of this, less of that, go pray. Put off distractions, and pray strongly like a soldier in battle. Fight hard in prayer for your brothers and sisters. If there's anything between you and God now, now's the time to set it down. You know what it is. 
<p>
    <strong>Revelations 3:3 - Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.</strong>
    <p>
Remember what God told you in the beginning. Do not forget his words. How come Christians get to thinking eventually that things like homosexuality are OK? Satan's greatest lie that he continually uses is "did God really say?" when God really said.  And still today, this is his greatest tactic. Twisting the word and thus your mind! Remind yourself and strengthen yourself in God's word, like Did did "He strengthened himself in the LORD his God". Speak it if you have to, "I'm God's child". Remember who he's made you to be. This isn't some Osteen "Truths To Speak Over Your Life" nonsense, this is the truth, speak it if you have to! We are his chosen people. What I'm saying here is, remember you're His child and don't sell yourself out again to idols of your past or sins from our days of ignorance.
<p><strong>2 Timothy 3:14 - 15 - You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</strong>
<p>
One of the scariest thing I've read of is this: "But I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Therefore, remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and I will remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent." 
<p>
What has your heart? 
<p>
"If you're wrapped up so much in a house, furniture, clothes, shopping, all of those things, none of them evil themselves, but if they have your heart, you can never put the things of God first. You will go further into defilement. It only becomes defiled when you neglect the things of God. And you go after those things at the expense of the things of God. Oh God, I'm sorry for my interests replacing your interests." - David Wilkerson. 
<p>
Let me make a point that needs to be made: God gives us tools. Incredible things that we ENJOY to use for His kingdom. The problem is when we idolize those tools rather than the giver. We can spend so much time creating and working but forget to get in His presence!
<p>
I was praying tonight and didn't have the words to say. I asked God to give me something to pray over and I opened my Bible and was on Matthew 6:19-21. Once again, where's your treasure, where's your heart? What do you think about and speak about? 
What's tying you down? Whatever it is, rid it! You know what it is. What steals your heart from him. What takes your time from him. What steals your attention from Him! "Whatever you'd rather do than pray - is an idol."
<p><strong>
"Revelation 3:21 - To the one who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne."</strong>
<p>What a glorious thing to read. What is anything worth compared to this? When we have lost of ourselves and gained Christ, we will partake in this heavenly eternal kingdom. When we lose our earthly treasure to trade for God's heavenly treasure. For what is earthly possessions but dust, just like we are, man made it, and that man will or has died and was forgotten. Same as all the fancy belongings everyone carried on the Titanic got buried, rusted over, or disintegrated. 
<p>Don't feel you're at a loss when you lose something here, remember God has better things for you. When you’re losing things in this life… Know it’s that God loves you and is leading you. Don't be afraid to hand him everything, it's not like he hates you and wants to take away your very joy - but replace it with one that's eternal. 
<p>
When I read Revelations today, I no longer view it as a warning of damnation, but a love letter of hope from God to his people. "Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent" never think God hates you, He found it worthy to send his son to die for our transgressions.
He says "repent and be cleansed" not to steal your very being from you but to exchange with you holy clean garments, and to be able to fellowship with Him. 
<p>
Lastly I leave you with this. 

<p><strong>"Revelation 3:11 - I am coming quickly; hold firmly to what you have, so that no one will take your crown."</strong>
<p>Nothing can steal from us this hidden treasure in our hearts. We must remain in Him and "walk as he walked". No compromise, no change, God's word never changes. Don't be afraid to fight, God leads the army. "But be strong and courageous! Do not be terrified, do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." 
<p>
But not only that, but "I am coming quickly". Make sure the house is in order. Don't let there be any defiling in the temple, blasphemous idols and such. He is coming quickly! Here on this earth we simply long to know Him and be with him, almost like we're just in the waiting room. Don't get attached to anything here. "Eyes For Eternity" as I've said, keep your eyes on Him. Use the tools he's given you to build onto his kingdom, but focus on the giver rather than the tools. He gave those to you because he loves you and wants YOU(!) to help build His kingdom! 
<p>
Hold firmly to what you have! "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us." This treasure is within us. Grasp it, take hold of it, put on the armor and FIGHT. Remember God is ahead of the army and fights with us like he did Israel. God won't let his remnant become some depressed, miserable, weighed down little group of people. He takes care of his people. 
<p>
Don't turn to the left or right or let anything distract you here. All things are futile and worthless in the view of the surpassing value of simply knowing God and being known by him. So go know him. Don't be afraid to fight, even if you lose your life, you've only lost this earthly casing and have lost all pain and struggles and will be with your father forever - sin is gone! What else do we yearn for?
<p>
Back to David, he even had a priest Abiathar, even he couldn't help him - David had to get a word straight from God, not a man, just like you and me. Friends, let us draw close. Keep fighting the fight, the promised land is getting closer!
