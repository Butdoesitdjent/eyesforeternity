In Jesus's day, large crowds followed Him to where He'd teach, baptize, heal, feed them, they'd shout His name and rejoice and praise Him. Many followed Him. But how many followed Him to the cross? How many got up there with Him? How many were there still shouting His name in praise as they were shortly before when they were in the streets? Truly many say they want to follow Jesus but will not follow Him to the cross. So many, even Christians want the riches of this life, to be spoken of well by men, to be accepted, approval, happiness, riches, easy living, yet there's nothing easier to being a disciple than a cross. When you're on that cross, people can do anything to you that they wish… spit on you, mock you, stab you - and certainly they will not speak well of you! Yet many seek approval of men, to be raised up, and be recognized. To be SOMETHING. And just as it was then for Jesus - the biggest temptation for the Christian is "come down, save yourself!" 
<br>When you're up there, you lose everything, no will of your own. Two hands and two feet, you cannot grab things of the world or walk where you wish. And when you're up there on that cross, with those nails just holding you on… All you feel is the pain of death as your life is emptied out. All that's left is the will of the Father. What mattered before doesn't now. You're there alone, without your friends and comforts behind you. No more playing in the world in drunkenness and immorality. You lose those grudges you had… You lose those opinions you had… The earth fades away as you see what's important with the Kingdom in view. Truly the way to the Kingdom is death.</br>
<br>When we lose our life, we truly find our place in heaven. Let earth fade away and crumble with our minds on God and His coming Kingdom! Don't look back! Baruch Hashem!</br>
<br>Hebrews 11:2-26</br>
<br><strong>[Moses] chose rather to endure I'll-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasure of sin, considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the riches of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.</strong></br>
<br>Hebrews 13:12-14</br>
<br>Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood. So then, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.</strong></br>
<br>John 15:4-5</br>
<br>"Remain in Me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself but must remain in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me. “I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me, and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.</strong></br>
<br><i>"If you haven't been to the cross, there is no salvation and there is no forgiveness. But it's the only way you can meet God, it's the only way you can have forgiveness… It's the cost of discipleship"</i></br>
<br> - Billy Graham </br>
<br><i>"There's only one way into the kingdom, and that's death."</i></br> 
<br> - Leonard Ravenhill </br>
