<h1><strong>Hidden Idol Series: Politics</strong></h1>
<h2><center>How can politics become an idol? Well, it can become an idol when we put all of our time, energy, and resources into these different matters. Whether prime ministers, presidents, governors, world leaders, or politicians on either side that is competing for leader, for dominance. We know more about the latest news, what is trending, and the different laws and agendas being passed than we know about the Word of God. We may know the Word of God but we aren’t focused with all of our heart, soul, and mind into these matters. We care more and delight more in what was going on in the world, with our world leaders than we care more about the Word of God. In fact, politics can become a distraction and an idol. When you stand up more for your political party than you do the Word of God that becomes an idol. When you know more and speak more about what’s going on in politics than you do the Word of God, that’s an idol. In fact, it's keeping you from spreading the Word of God and fulfilling the Great Commission. In fact, politics is the very reason many people don’t even see the true Word of God. It keeps them distracted. It keeps them preoccupied so that they watch the latest news and are busy studying and reading on what is going on in the world rather than making sure that their heart, soul, and mind is prepared for God’s kingdom. That they are ready for His coming and doing the work of God and not sleeping. Make sure that you’re awake.
