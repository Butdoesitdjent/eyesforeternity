<h1><strong>Hidden Idol Series: Health</strong></h1>
<h2><center>How can health become an idol? Health can become an idol when we try everything in our power to remain healthy. You’ll know if it's an idol the moment you become sick. Are you still seeking God? Are you still rejoicing? Think about how much you spend in order to stay healthy. Your supplements, all your vitamins, all your exercise, all your organic foods. These things are not bad in itself. But it can become an idol when you care more about keeping your muscle mass and your physical shape and your physique and remaining healthy than you do seeking God. And in fact, many times we can think “Well I’m doing these things while seeking God. But not realizing that we put these matters over seeking God. And in fact, we want to do everything we can to stay healthy. The moment we become sick, especially those who are in chronic illness. They start cursing God or they start wondering, asking God “Why?”. They start hating God and they start falling away and trying to seek things in the world to bring them pleasure and satisfaction. This can become an idol when we try to hold on to our health so much. We are afraid to lose it. And afraid to pray, “whatever it takes God”, in order to bring people to you and live for you in holiness and true surrender. This, if you are willing to lose your health in order for God’s kingdom, it’s not an idol. But if you are afraid to lose your good health for God’s kingdom, it’s an idol.
