<h1><strong>Hidden Idol Series: Romance</strong></h1>
<h2><center>Did you know that romance can become an idol? Yes, in fact, romance can become an idol when we do anything by our means to keep romance in our lives. In fact, we can reminisce on old times and how times used to be about romance. In fact, we can seek romance novels, we can see romantic things that's why many people love Valentine's Day and many days like it because they want anything that’s romantic. In fact, many times people lust and desire after other men and women that are living romantically, things that are very sweet. So they judge their spouses based on what other people do in their lives, so how other people's marriages or relationships are with boyfriends or girlfriends or spouses, husbands, and wives. They will judge their relationships based on their own romance and if they are lacking romance they feel like they are missing something and in fact, it becomes an idol because you desire it. And you want to keep romance in your life by any means necessary so that you miss the past, you won’t move on to the future and you sit there and you desire to gain more romance on your life rather than seeking God. In fact, romance is a lot of times a replacement for God’s holy presence, which is an idol.
