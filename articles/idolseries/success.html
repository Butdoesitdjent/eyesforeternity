<h1><strong>Hidden Idol Series: Success</strong></h1>
<h2><center>How is success an idol? Well, success is an idol when we do anything by any means necessary to become successful. In fact, the money is on the mind and our minds on the money. We’re doing anything we can to acquire that success, climb that career ladder, have our breakthrough. When you hear people saying, you are about to have your breakthrough, guess what they’re revealing? That they have a secret desire for success. You want to climb that career ladder, you are working on a project and you are trying to be successful in that project. You cater to your dreams and your goals and your aspirations. And you want to reach that goal by any means necessary because you’re lacking something inside. You’re lacking the presence of God and you are prideful. You are trying to show off to others that you can be successful, that you have some kind of worth. Rather than finding your worth in God’s Word and God’s kingdom. You seek success when you’re trying to do anything you can by any means necessary to acquire riches and money and become successful to show off to others. Secretly, you have this secret ambition, self ambition to become successful in the world. And you show off to your neighbors, your family, your friend and your co-workers, and your former classmates to show that you are successful. And you want to show off to others and that’s why success can become a secret idol. 
<p>“The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.”
