<h1><strong>Hidden Idol Series: Career and Job</strong></h1>
<h2><center>How can a job and a career become an idol? Well, it can become an idol when we start putting our desire to move up in a company and climb that career ladder or make more money for promotions, above seeking God and His Word. And in fact, takes more of our time in our pleasure, satisfaction, and enjoyment than time with God. Some people may try to climb that career ladder and move up in their company or their job or trying to gain further promotions that acquire more wealth. Or have people desire them or their skill assets more than time with God. They care more about what people think of them in their physical position than they do in their spiritual position. This in fact can become an idol.
 Youâ€™ll also know if it starts to become an idol when you start putting all your time, energy, and efforts into trying to obtain more resources, more finances or climb that career ladder. You care more about what people at your company, and your job, and your career things than you care more about what your family, your spouse, and your kids think. Or even God for that matter. This can become an idol when you start, you will start noticing that all you start doing is talking about your job and wanting to be around your co-workers and others that are on the same path of trying to climb that career ladder and gain more promotion and riches as you. This can be in fact, an idol when you no longer want to serve God with all your heart, soul, and mind. But you spend more time at your career and job and thinking about it than you do thinking about God and wanting to get alone with Him.
