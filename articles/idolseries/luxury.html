<h1><strong>Hidden Idol Series: Luxury</strong></h1>
<h2><center>How is luxury an idol? Well, luxury is an idol when we do anything we can to remain in luxury. In fact, many times the people that love luxury and its an idol, love to travel in luxury. They love to fly in luxury. They love to ride in luxury. They love their cars that are luxurious. They love hotels and buildings and houses that are luxury. That’s why they buy a house, they do everything they can to make the inside of their house look beautiful and the outside. They want to ride in luxury and drive in luxury so everything that they do is catered to living in that prosperous ease. So deep inside there’s something that’s missing. They’re missing the presence of God. They’re missing the luxury and the riches of God’s presence inside them so they seek outside and externally to make them feel like they’re at worth, that they have a net worth in the world. Meanwhile, they’re missing the presence of God and the true worth of His presence, and the luxury of his kingdom and His Word. In fact, they deny the Word and live in the world for luxury. They do everything they can to acquire and live it in order to make themselves feel better while judging everybody else that’s not living in luxury. In fact, luxury is an idol when we care more about what people think based on our image and we want to hold and live in that luxury no matter what. And we’ll do whatever it takes to remain in luxury than rather to lose it. This in fact where an idol remains.
