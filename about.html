<h1><center>Howdy, my name's Zach. I'm the guy that runs this site! I enjoy doing amateur coding in my free time - what a better way to use it than for the Kingdom.
    A bit about myself, I'm a guitar player - specifically in extended range guitar (guitars with more than 6 strings, ie, 7 and 9 string), I write perform a weird blend that's based around progressive metal, but takes influence from jazz, classical, and other styles.
    <p>This site was begun in July 2022 just for the fun of coding something. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220809230037/http://eyesforeternity.vercel.app" style="color:black">The original homepage</a> was boring, bland, and dark (not to mention it didn't resize well on mobile!). In August I spent much time developing and redesigning this site into what I believe God wants it to be.
        <p>As for the name, the phrase came from an impactful post from brother Todd Aaron on Instagram:</p>
        <a href="images/todd_eyesforeternity.png"><img src="images/todd_eyesforeternity.png" alt="Todd Post" width="245vw" height="500vw"/></a>
<p>It's been something that's stuck with me and I've used it for account usernames and such, but when I started on this site, I <b>KNEW</b> this was the right name. 
        <p>There's not a whole lot to say for myself or my life. But I hope this gives you an adequate background of who I am. I hope you've found this sight useful, if you ever want/need to contact me regarding anything about this site, you can reach me <a href="mailto:butdoesitdjent05@gmail.com" style="color:black">here.</a></p>
