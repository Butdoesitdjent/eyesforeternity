<p>Something within me is beginning to change a lot lately.
<p>I've wasted many months judging my worth based on how much of what I do.
<p>I don't pray enough.
<p>I'm not in the Word enough.
<p>I don't spend enough time with friends.
<p>I don't practice on the guitar enough.
<p>And while I am learning godly discipline in being in His Word and prayer, I've realized God doesn't judge my life on how much I do. But rather on the quality of all things I do.
<p style="color:aqua"><i>1 Corinthians 3:13 NASB20 — each one’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each one’s work.</i></p>
<p>>Notice how Paul says "quality" and not "quantity"? Do not base your value on how much you've done - ultimately Christ's sacrifice is far more valuable than any life's work. But pay attention to the quality. Sow seeds, keep prayer behind what you do, as well as love and firm godliness. Working too much brings stress. Regulated work with quality is wonderful. And when done for the LORD, can show much fruit.</p
