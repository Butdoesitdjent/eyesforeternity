<p>If one is not truly happy and joyful heart, it is most likely that there are things in their life that have been left unsurrendured to God. Worries and cares of this life, dreams, passions, even prejudices or grudges, or even a certain sin that has not been handed over. True joy comes from having surrendered all things unto God and resting under His rule, as He carries us through life like a ski-lift carries you above many hills. You have to trust that ski-lift to not drop you, and you have to surrender your fear of heights and just trust. Truly what weighs a person's heart down is love of money, love of the world, sin, idols, dreams, grudges, etc. That weight can turn into shame, and that shame into hatred of God, and that can turn you into a Romans 1 type of person.
<p>Truly the greater the surrender, the greater the measure of joy in one's life! Trusting God with and through all things instead of taking it on yourself is true peace and joy of heart. The more we surrender of this life, the more we see through this life into eternity, true joy and eternal riches.
<p>If you're feeling weighed down, angry, guilty, depressed with or without reason, or in any way unsettled in your heart. Chances are there's something that needs to be laid down. I can't tell you, you must pray and ask God to show you what it is.
