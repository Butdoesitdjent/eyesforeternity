<p>
In Jesus's day, large crowds followed Him to where He'd teach, baptize, heal, feed them, they'd shout His name and rejoice and praise Him. Many followed Him. But how many followed Him to the cross? How many got up there with Him? How many were there still shouting His name in praise as they were shortly before when they were in the streets? Truly many say they want to follow Jesus but will not follow Him to the cross. It even got to in <p style="color:aqua">John 6:67</p> that many departed, saying "this message is too hard... who can hear it?" 
<p>So many, even most Christians want the riches of this life, to be spoken of well by men, to be accepted, approval, happiness, riches, easy living, yet there's nothing easier to being a disciple than a cross. When you're on that cross, people can do anything to you that they wish… spit on you, mock you, stab you - and certainly they will not speak well of you! Just as Judas sold Jesus/Yeshua out for his own gain, many will do so to you - just as they gambled with Jesus' clothes... So they will to you. Yet many seek approval of men, to be raised up, and be recognized. Seeking their own gain in this world, building up Babylon with their own self goals and desires and careers, yet not God's kingdom! Seeking their own gain but no care for the interests of others. For the Christian, just as it was then for Jesus - the biggest temptation is "come down, save yourself!" 
<br>When you're up there, you lose everything, no will of your own. Two hands and two feet, you cannot grab things of the world or walk where you wish. And when you're up there on that cross, with those nails just holding you on… All you feel is the pain of death as your life is emptied out. All that's left is the will of the Father. What mattered before doesn't now. You're there alone, without your friends and comforts behind you. No more playing in the world in drunkenness and immorality. You lose those grudges you had… You lose those opinions you had… The earth fades away as you see what's important with the Kingdom in view. Truly the way to the Kingdom is death.</br>
<br>When we lose our life, we truly find our place in heaven. Let earth fade away and crumble with our minds on God and His coming Kingdom! Keeping seeking God! Don't look back! Baruch Hashem!</br>
<br>Hebrews 11:2-26</br>
<br><strong style="color:aqua">[Moses] chose rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasure of sin, considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the riches of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.</strong></br>
<br>Hebrews 13:12-14</br>
<br><strong style="color:aqua">Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood. So then, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.</strong></br>
<br>John 15:4-5</br>
<br><strong style="color:aqua">"Remain in Me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself but must remain in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me. “I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me, and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.</strong></br>
<br><i>"If you haven't been to the cross, there is no salvation and there is no forgiveness. But it's the only way you can meet God, it's the only way you can have forgiveness… It's the cost of discipleship"</i></br>
<br> - Billy Graham </br>
<br><i>"There's only one way into the kingdom, and that's death."</i></br> 
<br> - Leonard Ravenhill </br>
