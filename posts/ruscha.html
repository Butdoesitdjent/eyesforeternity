<p>Ruscha was a Christian rock band formed by two Siberian brothers, Nikolai and Peter Pankratz in 1987. In 1988, the band released their debut album, <p style="color:aqua"><i>"Come Alive"</p></i> on their very own Pan-Trax records. This same year they toured with PETRA on the This Means War! tour.
The album was fairly successful in the United States, and attracted the attention of a few large secular labels. A few singles from the album, <p style="color:aqua"><i>"Come Alive", "Come Home"</p></i> and <p style="color:aqua"><i>"The Word Stands Forever"</p></i> charted on Christian radio stations and The Billboard in 1988. After the success of this album, Nikolai secured an agreement with Sony/CBS Records, but right after the agreement was signed, Andy Denton, Billy Williams, and Mike Jacobs circumvented the band to sign a deal with Word Records and release their own music under the band name Archon. The name didn't stick for long (they only released one song under this name), and they changed this to Legend Seven for their first and only release, "Blind Faith".
<p>In 1992, the band released their second album, Invisible Hands, which was sung exclusively in Russian. Apparently the brothers recorded yet a third album, but decided not to take it to a label, and just shared it amongst friends and family. The title of this release is not known.

<p>Nikolai went on to record a few solo albums in Russian, but never released them until a few years ago. According to a friend of the Pankratz's, Nikolai is still a believer, but "does not want anything to do with the Christian [music] market". He is occasionally producing films in Hollywood and accepts speaking engagements. Peter lives a quiet life in Tennessee.
<p>After Legend Seven's breakup in 1994, Andy Denton went on to start another band, Identical Strangers, in the mid-90's with Sweet Comfort Band member Randy Thomas. In 1999, he released his own solo album, <p style="color:aqua"><i>"Midnight of Hope".</p></i>
