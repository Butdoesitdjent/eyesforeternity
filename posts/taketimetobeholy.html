<p>If you don't have dedicated time to read the Word, pray, and in general spend time with God, your work will end up being lifeless. It can be easy to deceive man with many works, but God knows the heart better than any, and He sees everything. And slowly, because you aren't satisfied in God, and spending time in His Word and prayer, you'll begin to try and do more to seek the attention and approval of man. 
<P>One of the devil's greatest tactics is to get us preoccupied with many things. To take us away from being in the Word and being in prayer. And he will even use things that aren't inherently bad or are even godly to distract us, like ministry. We can become so busy with our work for the Kingdom that the King Himself gets neglected. The devil also wants to get you to waste your time - it can be easy to waste time on entertainment rather than seeking God's face. In these days it is incredibly important to remain sober [1 Peter 1:13] and not to be so busy and destracted like people in the days of Noah [Matthew 24:37].</P>

<p>Make sure you're in communion with Him! Only then will your work, and ultimately your life, be set ablaze.</p>
