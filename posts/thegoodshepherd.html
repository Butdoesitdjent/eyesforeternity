<p>For the past few years, one of my greatest fears has been deception. A very big fear. But something hit me tonight like a ton of bricks.
<p>If we are truly repentant, and entertain no sin in my life, and allow no grudge, and truly seek God from a clean conscience - He will not allow us to go astray. He cannot. He is a good Shepherd! He leads all His people in ways of righteousness.</p>
<p>The LORD is not like that devil Allah in the Quran, where it says Allah is the greatest of all deceivers, and anyone - even Muslims, can come under His deception. The LORD is not this way.</p>
<p>The only time I've seen believers led into doctrines of demons and deception is because they let one certain thing into their life - some kind of sin. You will only be led astray if you're worshipping idols. It is idols and sin that lead astray to deception and death. I've seen people entertain doubt and not deal with it. I've seen people highly value entrepreneurship and being cool and worldly. And treating both like idols, and ultimately becoming led astray. Putting anything before God is an idol and will lead you astray. Whether it's valuing health, money, a job, entertainment, any skill above God, or entertaining doubt. That is an idol. Those will lead you astray. But God will not, if you are truly repentant! He loves you. With His help, tare down those idols.</p>
