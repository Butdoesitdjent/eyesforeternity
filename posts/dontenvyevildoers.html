<p>Sometimes I feel sad looking at the world, especially worldly Christians. They seem so happy, infact I think they are. They seem to have no worries in this life. They're doing and achieving big and important things. Some are putting out albums and podcasts, others are opening their own shops and stores. They're doing things. While I'm here silent with not really anything going besides a decent job I'm thankful for. But Psalms 37 comes to mind:
<p style="color:aqua"><i>Don't be envious of wrongdoers, for they will wither quickly like grass.</i></p>
<p>(V. 1b-2a)
<p>They will all suddenly be no more. Who will remember them? The righteous who truly walk with God will inherit the land. They are successful and loved by the world; I am a failure, but loved by Yeshua. They may have much in this life, but I have Yeshua now and forevermore.</p>
<p>Briefly, I'm reminded of a section of John Bunyan's "The Pilgrims Progress". Christian, on his journey to the celestial city, comes across two boys, Passion and Patience. Both have a reward due to them, but Passion chooses to receive his immediately. He receives it, and laughs and mocks at Patience, who has nothing. But quickly, his reward turns into rags, and he is left with nothing. Then Patience is finally given his due reward, and it never goes bad. He can enjoy it forever, and laughs with joy as Passion is left with rags.</p>
