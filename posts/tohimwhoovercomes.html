<p>
In this time there is a greater delusion and confusion than ever. Many are amazed and attracted to an image of God, yet not the essence of. Because they have never known God or loved him (John 14:7), many are searching after other "cover ups" to make themselves feel saved:
<br> - Knowledge</br>
<br> - Peace (some familiar spirit thing) </br>
<br> - Physical side of Judaism </br>
<br> - Leaning on words of men, whether godly or not</br>
<br>Because they have never known his voice or heard it, they are gathering with those just like them (Matt 24:28, Amos 8:11). Those who can't stop arguing online about this and that and the other thing aren't hearing from God. Truly those being lead by the Father are being led off of social media and into mroe prayer.</br> 
<p style="color:aqua">But what about us?</p>
<br>We see a famine right now, a lack of the word of God. Just as in Joseph's time when a famine swept over the land, there he was prepared. This is our time to prepare. Many will flock to US for answers and help… Don't take any thought for what you'll say, if the spirit is in you, he'll speak. (John 14:7,26)</br>
<br>But even with the dark clouds on the horizon, we must remember the sun behind the clouds. We seem to often forget the little things. Sometimes, we think God is too big for the small things!
We've got to keep reminding ourselves who's we are. This isn't some "15 Truths To Speak Over Your Life" nonsense, this isn't some name-it-and-claim-it Joel Osteen mess! This is the word of God!</br>
<p style="color:aqua">“I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you." - John 14:18</p>
<br>I've said it before and I'll say it again - it's a true statement - God won't let his people become some depressed, broken, dry, lifeless little group of people. No friends, we are his remnant. I'm seeing all over His word now how God cherishes and delights in his people who delight in Him; he will keep his hands around us. 
Yes, there is great persecution around the corner! But!! God will not let us go into persecution without an outpouring! He won't send us into battle without the readying and preparation! We must be yearning for this "Pentecost, at any cost"... God is readying many now, and I FIRMLY believe there will be a greater outpouring than in Acts!</br>
<br>Now this is where my message is summed up:</br>
<p style="color:aqua">"And [God] called for a famine upon the land; He broke the whole staff of bread. He sent a man before them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave. They forced his feet into shackles, He was put in irons; Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of the Lord refined him. The king sent and released him, The ruler of peoples, and set him free. He made him Lord of his house, And ruler over all his possessions, To imprison his high officials at will, That he might teach his elders wisdom. Israel also came into Egypt; So Jacob lived in the land of Ham. And He made His people very fruitful, and He made them stronger than their enemies. - Psalms 105:16‭-‬24</p> 
<br>We are not to "fear" the ways of the nations. Pay no mind to them, and do not fear the outcome of not walking in them, like Shadrach, Mesach, and Abednego. Be willing to walk through that flame! Just as I said… God will not let us go through the flames without His spirit with us. Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. Listen to no man, listen to God. 
God has given us strength that is stronger than that of our enemies/enemy. And just like Joseph… The word of the Lord is refining us! I sense we are ALL being instructed and built up now during this time. Those preaching such mess on social media must've taken a wrong exit somewhere. I can't explain why, but I'm hearing "Be quiet" right now just as many are hearing "be patient".</br>
<br>As a final note… </br>
<br>With the flood of encouraging messages from Greg Hershberg, Todd Aaron and others, let's not get complacent. "Seek his face CONTINUALLY"! Let's not put our legs up and say "I'm good, I'm saved". Do not dwell on old encouraging videos, though incredible, keep moving on, and don't rest there. 
<br>The redeemed Christian, the one who will inherit life, is the one who struggles against worldliness, against sin. The true Christian is always conscious of their short-comings, seeing we are but "slaves to Messiah" and truly do not claim to know anything by means of knowledge. A true Christian sees themselves as nothing great. God's greatest messengers will receive the greatest attacks! 
A life on your knees is not a life wasted: A true Christian is brought down by conviction to their knees, a true Christian is the one that doubts whether they will inherit true life because of their plaguing sin. A soldier fights!</br>
<br>That is all. When the times get hard, remind yourself who He's made you to be: not like the world. </br>
<p style="color:aqua>"For You have separated them from all the peoples of the earth as Your inheritance, as You spoke through Moses Your servant, when You brought our fathers forth from Egypt, O Lord God.” - 1 Kings 8:52‭-‬53 </p>
<br>Halleluyah! We have been brought out from Egypt. These are the simple things we forget too often. Remember what He's told you, remember his word, remember his works, remember his Laws.</br>
<p style="color:aqua">
"He has remembered His covenant forever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations."</p>
